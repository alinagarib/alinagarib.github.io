      <p>Hi! My name is Alina Garib. I am a fourth year at the University of Florida, and I am pursuing a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science, as well as a minor in Chinese Language and Literature. I am passionate about exploring technology, and I am constantly looking for new ways to strengthen my technical acumen. I am seeking opportunity to get involved with innovative, creative, and collaborative teams. </p>
      <p>This summer, I completed an internship at Chick-fil-A as a back-end software engineer. I developed a program to automate invoicing for sales made through a Square POS system in Java, saving 6 hours of accounting monthly. This was set up as an ECS task scheduled with EventBridge.</p>
      <p>Currently, I am a front-end software engineering intern at Satlantis US, working on building an internal tool for viewing satelite imagery data. I am also the program manager for the software teams at Real World Engineering club at UF, where I manage projects, deadlines, and communicate between our teams and the executive board. Last, I am a teaching assistant for Introduction to Software Engineering, where I guide students to learn the principles of web development. Outside of technology, I am an active member of the Florida Running Club, I enjoy spending time outdoors, with loved ones, and exploring local activities. Thanks for reading! Have a look around!
